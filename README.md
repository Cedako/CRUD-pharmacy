# CRUD-pharmacy
This is a simple homemade CRUD that uses MongoDB as database, it can perform CRUD operations for employees, medicines and tickets.

Clone this repository: ```git clone https://github.com/Cedako/CRUD-pharmacy.git```

Replace the string inside server.js in the MONGODB_URI const to your mongodb URI so it connects to your database.
